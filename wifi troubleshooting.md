Make sure your device’s Wi-Fi is on — Most laptops have a shortcut key that will turn off their Wi-Fi and it can be easy to press accidentally. Similarly, there is a quick toggle on most phones that will turn off the phone’s Wi-Fi capabilities.

Restart your router — A quick restart of your router (achieved by unplugging it, waiting 30 seconds to 1 minute, and plugging it back in again) can fix many Wi-Fi difficulties.

Check for an outage — Most ISP’s will have an outage map available on their website. Try using your phone’s data to check and see if an outage is reported in your area.
